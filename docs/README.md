## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env    # Configure your environment
# make sure FRONTEND_URL points to whatever frontend domain you'll use
# (e.g. https://your-app.vercel.app).  You can also provide a
# comma-separated list if you need to allow multiple origins.
npm install
npm run dev             # Starts on :5000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# when deploying, set VITE_API_BASE to your backend URL (e.g.
# https://panacea-backend.vercel.app).  If the backend lives in the
# same Vercel project under `/api`, you can omit the variable because
# our code will fall back to using the Vercel URL automatically.
npm run dev             # Starts on :5173
```

The frontend dev server proxies `/api/*` requests to `localhost:5000`.

## 🔔 Notifications Architecture

### Push Notifications (Primary)
- Uses **Web Push API** with **VAPID keys**
- Backend runs a **cron scheduler** every minute checking for medication timings
- When a timing matches, sends push notification via `web-push`
- Missed doses are auto-marked hourly

### Local Notifications (Fallback)
- When the PWA is open, `setTimeout`-based reminders are scheduled
- Works even without a Push subscription
- Limited: only works while the app tab is active

### Offline Handling
- Notifications are a known PWA limitation when offline/closed
- **Workaround**: The cron scheduler runs server-side, so push notifications work as long as the device has internet — the PWA doesn't need to be open
- When truly offline: the schedule is cached and shown from IndexedDB/service worker cache

## 📲 Capacitor Wrapping

This app is designed for easy wrapping with Capacitor:

```bash
# In the frontend directory
npm run build
npx cap init Panacea com.panacea.app
npx cap add android
npx cap sync
npx cap open android
```

### Capacitor-Ready Design Decisions
- No `window.open()` or browser-only APIs
- Safe area insets via `env()` CSS
- Touch targets ≥ 48px
- No hover-dependent interactions
- `tel:` links for native phone calling
- Standalone display mode in manifest
- Portrait orientation lock

## 🎨 Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Dark theme | Reduces eye strain for medical contexts, premium feel |
| Large touch targets (48px+) | Elderly-friendly, accessible |
| High contrast text | WCAG AA compliance for readability |
| Glassmorphism cards | Modern, depth without clutter |
| Bottom navigation | One-handed operation, native app feel |
| Persistent SOS button | Always accessible in emergencies |
| Staggered animations | Contemporary feel without compromising performance |

## 🔒 Security

- JWT tokens with configurable expiry
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- Helmet.js security headers
- Rate limiting (100 req / 15 min)
- Per-user file storage isolation
- File type validation for uploads
- CORS restricted to frontend origin
